## [1.18.0] - 2023-01-20
### Changed
- Updated project to work with Immersal SDK 1.18.0
- Updated Unity version to 2022.2.2f1

## [1.16.0] - 2022-03-03
### Changed
- Changed `NRLocalizer` registration to work with Immersal SDK 1.16
- Updated Unity packages

## [1.12.1] - 2021-05-04
### Changed
- `NRLocalizer.cs`: Better way for acquiring RGB camera position and intrinsics. Should result in more accurate localization.
- Project settings: Disabled URP for now, as the Nreal logo asset used in the project doesn't support it (URP can still be used of course).

### Added
- Support for RGB video capturing while localizing. This has the following prerequisites:
  * Disable Multithreaded Rendering in Android build settings
  * In the `ImmersalSDK.prefab`, disable 'Use YUV' in `NRLocalizer`
  * Enable the 'Canvas' and 'VideoCapture' GameObjects in the sample scene

## [1.12.0] - 2021-04-06

### Changed
- `NRLocalizer.cs`: Minor changes to reflect the Immersal SDK 1.10.0 API changes

## [1.9.0] - 2020-10-20
### Changed
- Updated for NRSDK 1.4.8 and ImmersalSDK 1.9.0
- Faster way of acquiring the camera pixel buffer

## [1.8.0] - 2020-09-11
### Added
- `NRYuvCamera.cs` to obtain the pixel buffer from Nreal Light's RGB camera
- `NRLocalizer.cs` to localize the headset against a map
- `NRAppController.cs`, a simple class for map loading and startup
- `HelloImmersal.unity` sample scene showing how to set up everything
- Known issues: Camera intrinsics might be a bit off, needs more research. Nreal Light's video capture cannot be used at the same time when running `NRLocalizer`.
